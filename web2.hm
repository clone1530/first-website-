        Love has no reason, nor has it any season. When you love someone, you do it from your heart. <br>When you love someone you do it from your soul. Such is my love for you my dear. I truly loved you yesterday.
          <br>I love you more today. And I shall love you tomorrow and till the end of time. You are the only reason why I feel so blessed in life. <br>You are my strength and my determination. I am really proud of you and lucky to have you.
          <br>I love you so much.

      When I say I love you, please believe it's true.<br>
      When I say forever, know I'll never leave you. <br>
      When I say goodbye, promise me you won't cry, <br>
      Because the day I'll be saying that will be the day I die.

      Sometimes I've felt alone and neglected,<br>
      unwanted and useless;<br>
      sometimes I've looked for someone,<br>
      but I've always failed to find that one.<br>
      <br>
      Until the day you came along<br>
      and you whispered a sweet song;<br>
      then I wondered and I smiled,<br>
      is he the one I've been looking for?<br>
      <br>
      From that day, everything has changed.<br>
      You made me feel important;<br>
      you taught me to smile in the midst of trials,<br>
      and you told me the reality of life.<br>
      <br>
      You filled me with so much happiness.<br>
      You have loved me even in my worst.<br>
      Thank you for changing my life.<br>
      Thank you for giving me such love.

      Whenever we are apart, I am constantly thinking of you. It is crazy how every little thing can remind me of you. <br>
      Your smile, your laugh, and the sound of your voice are never far from my thoughts. <br>
      I can remember the touch of your hand as though you are right here sitting next to me. <br>
      No matter how far apart we are, you are always in my heart and in my thoughts, and your name is always on the edge of my lips. <br>
      Your presence in a room makes my light feel so much lighter and my heart yearns for you when you are far away from me. <br>
      Now that we are miles apart, I cannot wait until we are together again. <br>
      When I see you again, I will never want to leave your side.
